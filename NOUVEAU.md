To install the Nouveau driver on Arch Linux, follow these steps:

1. Update your system:
   Open a terminal and update your system's package database and all installed packages:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```
   
3. Install the Nouveau driver:
   The Nouveau driver is included in the xf86-video-nouveau package. Install it using pacman:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S xf86-video-nouveau
   ```
   
5. Remove any conflicting drivers:
   If you have previously installed proprietary NVIDIA drivers, remove them to avoid conflicts:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Rns nvidia nvidia-utils
   ```
   
7. Configure the boot loader:
   Make sure the nouveau kernel module is loaded at boot. This is typically automatic, but you can ensure it by adding it to your boot loader configuration.

   For example, if you're using GRUB, edit `/etc/default/grub`:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/default/grub
   ```
   
   Add `nouveau.modeset=1` to `the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line:

   ```
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="nouveau.modeset=1"
   ```
   
   Then update the GRUB configuration:
   ```
   sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```
   
9. Reboot:
   Reboot your system to apply the changes:

   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
   
10. Verify the installation:
   After rebooting, verify that the Nouveau driver is being used. You can check the loaded kernel modules and Xorg logs.

   To check the kernel modules:

   ```
   lsmod | grep nouveau
   ```

   To check the Xorg log:

   ```  
   cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i nouveau
   ```

If the Nouveau driver is correctly installed and loaded, you should see output related to the Nouveau driver in both commands.

By following these steps, you should have the Nouveau driver installed and running on your Arch Linux system.
